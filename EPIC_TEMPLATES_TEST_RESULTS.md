## Uniqueness Analysis

âœ… **All templates are unique with no significant overlap**

Each template has:
- Distinct detection keywords
- Unique field structures
- Specific clinical focus
- No redundancy with other templates

---

## Detection Improvements Made

### Initial Test Results (Before Fixes)
- **Pass Rate**: 2/9 (22.2%)
- **Issues**: 
  - Shift Assessment detected as SOAP
  - MAR detected as DAR
  - I&O detected as SOAP
  - Med-Surg detected as SOAP
  - ICU detected as SOAP
  - NICU detected as PIE
  - Mother-Baby detected as SOAP

### After First Fix
- **Pass Rate**: 7/9 (77.8%)
- **Remaining Issues**:
  - MAR still detected as DAR
  - I&O still detected as SOAP

### After Final Fix
- **Pass Rate**: 9/9 (100%)
- **All templates correctly detected**

### Key Improvements
1. **Prioritized Epic-specific keywords** over generic nursing terms
2. **Added scoring boosts** for highly specific templates (ICU, NICU, Mother-Baby)
3. **Improved MAR detection** by counting multiple medication routes
4. **Enhanced I&O detection** by requiring both intake AND output keywords
5. **Strengthened shift assessment** by requiring both shift phase AND system assessment

## Template Detection Keywords

### Highly Specific (Unique to One Template)
- **ICU**: hemodynamic, cvp, ventilator, peep, fio2, rass, cam-icu, titration
- **NICU**: isolette, thermoregulation, premature, developmental care, parental bonding
- **Mother-Baby**: fundal, lochia, perineum, breastfeeding, latch, cord care, circumcision
- **Wound Care**: pressure injury, stage ii/iii/iv, granulation, slough, eschar
- **Safety Checklist**: fall risk, restraints, isolation, code status (requires 3+)

### Moderately Specific (Shared but Contextual)
- **MAR**: medication administration + multiple routes (PO, IV, IM, SQ, SL, PR)
- **I&O**: intake + output + balance (requires combination)
- **Med-Surg**: patient education, discharge planning, mobility, ambulated
- **Shift Assessment**: shift phase + system-by-system assessment (neuro, cardiac, etc.)
