# NurseScribe AI - Setup Instructions for Real Functionality

## üö® CRITICAL: Your App is Currently in DEMO Mode

Your app **transcribes voice correctly** but **generates FAKE notes** because the OpenAI API is not configured. Here's how to make it fully functional:

---

## Phase 1 MVP - Making It Real (Not Demo)

### Step 1: Get an OpenAI API Key (REQUIRED)

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with `sk-...`)
5. **Cost**: ~$0.002 per note (very cheap with GPT-4o-mini)

### Step 2: Configure Your Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your OpenAI key:
```env
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key-here
```

3. Restart your development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Test the Full Workflow

1. **Start Recording**: Click the microphone button
2. **Speak**: Say something like:
   ```
   "Patient presents with chest pain, pain level 6 out of 10. 
   Vital signs: blood pressure 118 over 76, heart rate 88, 
   respiratory rate 18, oxygen saturation 98%, temperature 99.2 degrees. 
   Patient is alert and oriented times three, no acute distress."
   ```
3. **Stop Recording**: Click stop
4. **Wait for AI**: The app will now call OpenAI to generate a REAL professional note
5. **Review Draft**: Check the AI-generated content (not fake data)
6. **Export**: Copy to clipboard or download

## What's Currently Working vs. What's Broken

### ‚úÖ Working (Demo Mode):
- Voice transcription (Web Speech API)
- Template selection (SOAP, SBAR, PIE, DAR)
- UI/UX and navigation
- Export functionality (copy/download)
- Mock note generation (fake data)

### ‚ùå Not Working (Needs API Key):
- **Real AI note generation** - Currently shows fake/mock data
- **ICD-10 suggestions** - Uses basic pattern matching instead of AI
- **Clinical reasoning** - No actual medical intelligence
- **Quality assessment** - Fake confidence scores

---

## Current Code Flow (What Happens Now)

### Without API Key (DEMO MODE):
```
Voice Input ‚Üí Transcription ‚úì
    ‚Üì
AI Service Called ‚Üí API Key Missing ‚ùå
    ‚Üì
Fallback to Mock Data ‚Üí Shows Fake Note ‚ùå
    ‚Üì
Export Fake Note ‚Üí Not Real Documentation ‚ùå
```

### With API Key (REAL MODE):
```
Voice Input ‚Üí Transcription ‚úì
    ‚Üì
AI Service Called ‚Üí OpenAI API ‚úì
    ‚Üì
Real AI Generation ‚Üí Professional Note ‚úì
    ‚Üì
Export Real Note ‚Üí Ready for EHR ‚úì
```

## Verification Checklist

After adding your API key, verify these work:

- [ ] Voice transcription captures your speech
- [ ] AI generates DIFFERENT content each time (not same fake data)
- [ ] Notes include specific details from your transcription
- [ ] ICD-10 codes are relevant to what you said
- [ ] Confidence scores change based on input quality
- [ ] Export contains real, usable documentation

---

## Cost Estimates (OpenAI API)

Using GPT-4o-mini (recommended):
- **Per Note**: ~$0.002 (less than a penny)
- **100 Notes**: ~$0.20
- **1,000 Notes**: ~$2.00
- **10,000 Notes**: ~$20.00

This is extremely affordable for professional use.

## Troubleshooting

### "AI service temporarily unavailable"
- Check your `.env` file has the correct API key
- Restart your dev server after adding the key
- Verify the key starts with `sk-`

### "Failed to generate note"
- Check your OpenAI account has credits
- Verify your API key is active
- Check browser console for error messages

### Notes still look fake/generic
- Make sure you restarted the server after adding the key
- Clear browser cache and reload
- Check the console for "OpenAI API key not found" warnings

## Next Steps After Setup

Once your API key is configured:

1. **Test thoroughly** with different medical scenarios
2. **Verify accuracy** of generated notes
3. **Adjust templates** if needed for your specialty
4. **Train your team** on proper voice input
5. **Monitor API costs** in OpenAI dashboard

---

## Phase 2+ Features (Already Built, Need Testing)

These features are coded but need real API to work properly:
- ICD-10 auto-suggestions with AI reasoning
- Smart templates for different specialties
- Clinical decision support
- Quality scoring and validation
- Medical terminology optimization

---

## Support

If you need help:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify your `.env` file is in the project root
3. Ensure the API key is valid and has credits
4. Test with a simple voice input first

---

## Security Notes

- **Never commit** your `.env` file to git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- **Never share** your OpenAI API key publicly
- **Rotate keys** regularly for security
- **Monitor usage** to prevent unexpected charges
- **Use environment variables** in production (not hardcoded keys)

---

## Summary

**Your app works for transcription, but generates fake notes without an OpenAI API key.**

To make it real:
1. Get OpenAI API key
2. Add to `.env` file
3. Restart server
4. Test with real voice input

That's it! The code is already built to handle everything else.
